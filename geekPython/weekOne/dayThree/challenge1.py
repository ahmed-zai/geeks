"""
Instructions: Old MacDonald’s Farm

You are given example code and output. Your task is to create a Farm class that produces the same output.


Step 1: Create the Farm Class

    Create a class called Farm.
    This class will represent a farm and its animals.


Step 2: Implement the __init__ Method

    The Farm class should have an __init__ method.
    It should take one parameter: farm_name.
    Inside __init__, create two attributes: name to store the farm’s name and animals to store the animals (initialize as an empty dictionary).


Step 3: Implement the add_animal Method

    Create a method called add_animal.
    It should take two parameters: animal_type and count (with a default value of 1). Count is the quantity of the animal that will be added to the animal dictionary.
    The dictionary will look like this:

{'cow': 1, 'pig':3, 'horse': 2}

    If the animal_type already exists in the animals dictionary, increment its count by count.
    If it doesn’t exist, add it to the dictionary as the key and with the given count as value.


Step 4: Implement the get_info Method

    Create a method called get_info.
    It should return a string that displays the farm’s name, the animals and their counts, and the “E-I-E-I-0!” phrase.
    Format the output to match the provided example.
    Use string formatting to align the animal names and counts into columns.
Step 5: Test Your Code

    Create a Farm object and call the add_animal and get_info methods.
    Verify that the output matches the provided example.
